    "So, you wanted to make a mod."
        "But it didn't quite go according to plan."
        "Things changed, parts that seemed easy, actually aren't."
        "The question is, how are you going to release anything?"
    
        "Well, it doesn't have to be hard, nor take a long time."
        "In fact, this is your chance!"
        "Welcome, to the Doki Doki #Comedy Club."
        "A compilation mod that gives the entire community a chance to make something!"
        "All you need to do is put together a suitable scenario, and submit it!"
        "I don't have time to go over all the specifics right now..."
        "Since I'm not getting paid enough to do so..."
        #VA very obviously turns away from microphone, appears to be talking/yelling to the background (loud enough to be heard)
        "Wait...you're not paying me for any of this."
        #Very obviously someone else's voice
        "Just read the lines."
        #Back to MC
        "...Fine."
        "For more information and specifics for how to submit, check r/DDLCMods by clicking the Help button in the main menu!"
        "The full mod is planned for release very soon, so get your creativity going!"
        "That is all. Happy modding!"
