DDCC Skit Submission Guidelines

    This document is to explain the ruleset that all scenario submissions must follow in order to be added and incorporated into the final version of the DDCC compilation mod.
    
    1. Submission Basics & Critera
    
        All submissions must follow the following base features:
        
        -Be around 5-60 seconds long, at average reading speed. ( Exceptions to this rule are possible, on a case-by-case basis. )
        -Contain a humorous and/or entertaining premise.
        -Must not contain any content beyond PG13. Crass language should be kept to a minimum. ( Exceptions to this rule are possible, on a case-by-case basis. )
        
        The Criteria of these submissions that the DDCC Project is looking for are:
        -Entertaining, self contained pieces of DDLC related content, including but not limited to - Parodies, Self-aware situations, 4th-wall breaks, alternate scenarios.
        -Technical submissions that could teach new things to anyone who looks at the code to learn from it. Well commented code for advanced and/or special tricks are appreciated.
        
    2. Submission Technicals
    
        All submissions must follow the following technical guidelines:
        
        -Your entry should be named 'script-XYZ.rpy'.
        -Your script may contain custom definitions. For large amounts, it is recommended that they are separated and submitted as 'definitions-XYZ.rpy'
        -Your entry may include custom assets. These assets must be submitted as a folder in mod_assets, and named XYZ.
        -Your entry should include a custom thumbnail, to be displayed in the selection screen. It's maximum resolution should be no more than 640x360
        -Assets should be named by the following set of defined rules:
            -Sounds: XYZ_sfx_name.wav
            -Music: XYZ_bgm00.ogg
            -Voices: XYZ_!00.wav
            -Backgrounds: XYZ_bg00.png
            -Sprites: XYZ_!_name.png
            -Thumbnail: XYZ_thumbnail.png
        LEGEND: XYZ - short name unique to your entry | ! - relevant character ( s, m, y, n, mc, or other ) | 00 - numeric value, starting from 01 | name - freeform label for files
        
        If you are submitting multiple entries, you may submit all your assets in a single folder, named after yourself. All other naming conventions for files must still apply.
        
        Shared Assets, such as a set of Main Character sprites, are available.
        If there are convenient definitions or custom assets you'd like to add
        into the project that you feel would help other submissions,
        you may submit them as shared assets for communal use.
        Shared Assets do not need to follow the naming conventions outlined above,
        but must still be submitted in a logical, and functional manner.
